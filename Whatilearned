I've been struggling with many errors theses days,
this is a directory to improve the way im learning laravel and how i resolved 
these errors.

 1.  Class "Category" not found 

  I forgot to import the class Category in my migration, then the problem were solved.

 2.   Illuminate\Database\QueryException 

  SQLSTATE[23000]: Integrity constraint violation: 1062 Duplicate entry 'admin@admin.com' for key 'users_email_unique' 

When i tried to seed all my DB i've got a Duplicate entry for the user admin, because i already seed the DB and i forgot it.
the solution was to migrate:fresh the db then put the flag --seed to seed all the DB .

The migrate:fresh command will drop all tables from the database and then execute the migrate command:

php artisan migrate:fresh
 
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

3.   Illuminate\Database\QueryException 

  SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1364 Field 'icon' doesn't have a default value (SQL: insert into `categories` 
  Here i had to implement the category table, because 'icon' value was missing,so i went to migrations and added the following
  sentence : $table->string('icon')->nullable();

  When i cleaned all the errors, then i did php artisan migrate:refresh --seed 
  and the database were seeded.
